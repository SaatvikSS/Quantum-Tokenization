# Quantum Tokenization Project

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

This project implements **Quantum-Safe Tokenization**, a cutting-edge approach to securing sensitive data using quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. The goal is to replace sensitive information (e.g., names, phone numbers, credit card numbers) with tokens that are irreversible without the decryption key and resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers.

By leveraging quantum-safe encryption algorithms, this system ensures long-term security for sensitive data, making it suitable for industries like finance, healthcare, and government that require robust protection against future technological advancements.

## Features

- **Quantum-Safe Encryption**: Uses post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to generate secure tokens.
- **Irreversible Tokens**: Tokens cannot be reversed without the decryption key, ensuring maximum security.
- **No Token Vault Dependency**: Encrypted tokens are self-contained, eliminating the need for a centralized token vault.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for distributed systems and high-performance environments.
- **Compliance Ready**: Meets or exceeds regulatory requirements for data protection (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, HIPAA).

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenSSL (for cryptographic operations)
- A quantum-safe cryptography library (e.g., [PQCrypto](https://pqcrypto.org/), [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs))
- Redis (optional, for token storage in distributed systems)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Quantum-Tokenization.git
   cd quantum-tokenization
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install a quantum-safe cryptography library:
   ```bash
   pip install pqcrypto
   ```

4. (Optional) Set up Redis for distributed token storage:
   ```bash
   docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
   ```

---

## Usage

### Tokenization

To tokenize sensitive data:

```python
from quantum_tokenization import tokenize

# Input sensitive data
sensitive_data = "Saat"

# Generate a quantum-safe token
token = tokenize(sensitive_data)
print(f"Token: {token}")
```

### Detokenization

To retrieve the original data from a token:

```python
from quantum_tokenization import detokenize

# Input the token
token = "TKN-a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0"

# Retrieve the original data
original_data = detokenize(token)
print(f"Original Data: {original_data}")
```

## Quantum-Safe Algorithms

This project supports the following quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms:

1. **Lattice-Based Cryptography**:
   - Example: CRYSTALS-Kyber (key exchange), CRYSTALS-Dilithium (digital signatures).
2. **Hash-Based Cryptography**:
   - Example: SPHINCS+ (stateless hash-based signatures).
3. **Code-Based Cryptography**:
   - Example: McEliece cryptosystem.
4. **Multivariate Polynomial Cryptography**:
   - Example: Rainbow signature scheme.

You can configure the algorithm used in the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
encryption_algorithm: "CRYSTALS-Kyber"
key_size: 256
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Tokenizing a Credit Card Number

```python
from quantum_tokenization import tokenize

credit_card_number = "4111-1111-1111-1111"
token = tokenize(credit_card_number)
print(f"Tokenized Credit Card: {token}")
```

Output:
```
Tokenized Credit Card: TKN-xyz123abc456def789
```

### Example 2: Detokenizing a Phone Number

```python
from quantum_tokenization import detokenize

token = "TKN-9876fedcba543210"
original_phone_number = detokenize(token)
print(f"Original Phone Number: {original_phone_number}")
```

Output:
```
Original Phone Number: +91 98223371202
```
